# MIXpy
MIX is a hypothetical computer described by Donald Knuth for
instructive use in The Art of Computer Programming. MIXpy (pronounced
mix-pea) provides a simulator for MIX, as well as an assembler for the
MIX Assembly Language (MIXAL). MIXpy is written in Python 3, and is
available through PyPI as "mixpy".

## MIX Simulator 
MIXpy realizes the MIX architecture as a collection of Python objects.

## MIXAL Assembler
MIXAL ("Mix Assembly Language") is a symbolic language designed to
make "MIX programs considerably easier to read and to write, and to
save the programmer from worrying about tedious clerical details that
often lead to unnecessary errors".
