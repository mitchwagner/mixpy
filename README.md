# MIXpy
MIX is a hypothetical computer described by Donald Knuth for
instructive use in The Art of Computer Programming. MIXpy
(pronounced mix-pea) provides a emulator for MIX, as well as an
assembler for the MIX Assembly Language (MIXAL). MIXpy is written
in Python 3, and is available through PyPI as "mixpy".

## MIX Emulator
MIXpy realizes the MIX architecture as a collection of Python
objects.

## MIXAL Assembler
MIXAL ("Mix Assembly Language") is a symbolic language designed
to make "MIX programs considerably easier to read and to write,
and to save the programmer from worrying about tedious clerical
details that often lead to unnecessary errors". MIXpy provides a
MIXAL assembler, also exposed as a Python object, to facilitate
the generation of MIX machine code, including the boot and
loading sequences a MIX computer requires to initialize and run a
program.
